 * Emitted by a Serenity/JS test runner adapter, right before a test and all its associated test hooks finish.
 * Triggers any clean-up operations that might be required, such as discarding of
 * the [discardable](https://serenity-js.org/api/core/interface/Discardable/) abilities.
 *
 * The `outcome` property contains the test outcome determined so far, before any cleanup operations.
 * This allows stage crew members like the WebdriverIO notifier to invoke hooks with the test result
 * before `waitForNextCue()` is called.
